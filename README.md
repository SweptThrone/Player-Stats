# Player Stats

### What is it?
Player Stats is a simple stats collector for your Garry's Mod server.  When a player joins, either for the first time or returns, it displays how many times they've joined and how many players have joined.

### How do I use it?
Download the whole thing and put the PlayerStats folder into your addons folder.  Configure it however you want and enjoy!  Players can type .mystats in chat to display their stats.

### What can I do with it?
I'm not gonna officially stick a license on it because I don't care that much, but you can modify it however you want, but please do not post reuploads on the workshop. There's literally no reason to reupload it anyway. If you want a new feature or something, just let me know or make a pull or fork or something, I don't know how this works.
